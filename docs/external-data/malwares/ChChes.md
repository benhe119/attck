## Description

### MITRE Description

> [ChChes](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0144) is a Trojan that appears to be used exclusively by [menuPass](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045). It was used to target Japanese organizations in 2016. Its lack of persistence methods suggests it may be intended as a first-stage tool.
