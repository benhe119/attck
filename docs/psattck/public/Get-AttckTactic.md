                     Command and Control consists of techniques that adversaries may use to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network. 
                     Adversaries commonly attempt to mimic normal, expected traffic to avoid detection. There are many ways an adversary can establish command and 
                     control with various levels of stealth depending on the victimâ€™s network structure and defenses.

                       Behavior that could indicate technique use include an unknown or unusual process accessing APIs associated with devices or software that 
                       interact with the microphone, recording devices, or recording software, and a process periodically writing files to disk that contain audio 
                       data.

                       to capture audio recordings for the purpose of listening into sensitive conversations to gather information.
                       
                       Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to 
                       capture audio. Audio files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later.

Detection            : Depending on the method used, actions could include common file system commands and parameters on the command-line interface within batch files 
                       or scripts. A sequence of actions like this may be unusual, depending on the system and network environment. Automated collection may occur 
                       along with other techniques such as [Data Staged](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074). As such, file access monitoring that shows an 
                       unusual process performing sequential file opens and potentially copy actions to another location on the file system for many files at once may 
                       indicate automated collection behavior. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather data. 
                       Data may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management 
                       Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086).

Aliases              : 
Description          : Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing 
                       this technique could include use of [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064) to search for and copy information fitting set 
                       criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals. This functionality could also be built into remote access tools. 
                       
                       This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such as [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) and 
                       [Remote File Copy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) to identify and move files.
