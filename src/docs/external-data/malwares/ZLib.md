### MITRE Description

> [ZLib](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0086) is a full-featured backdoor that was used as a second-stage implant by [Dust Storm](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0031) from 2014 to 2015. It is malware and should not be confused with the compression library from which its name is derived. (Citation: Cylance Dust Storm)
