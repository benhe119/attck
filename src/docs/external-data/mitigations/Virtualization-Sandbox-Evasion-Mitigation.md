# Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion Mitigation

## Description

### MITRE Description

> Mitigation of this technique with preventative controls may impact the adversary's decision process depending on what they're looking for, how they use the information, and what their objectives are. Since it may be difficult to mitigate all aspects of information that could be gathered, efforts should be focused on preventing adversary tools from running earlier in the chain of activity and on identifying subsequent malicious behavior if compromised.
