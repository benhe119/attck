# Custom Command and Control Protocol

## Description

### MITRE Description

> Adversaries may communicate using a custom command and control protocol instead of encapsulating commands/data in an existing [Standard Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071). Implementations include mimicking well-known protocols or developing custom protocols (including raw sockets) on top of fundamental protocols provided by TCP/IP/another standard network stack.
